# Record the audio from your computer

Before running the script, make sure you have a virtual audio cable software installed on your system, such as VB-CABLE or Virtual Audio Cable. Set the virtual audio cable as the default audio output device in your system's sound settings.

When running the script, it will capture audio from the virtual audio cable device, which should be routing audio played in the browser. Adjust the sample_rate and duration variables according to your requirements. Finally, provide a filename for the recording, and it will be saved as a WAV file.

Please note that the setup and configuration of virtual audio cables can vary depending on the software you use, so consult the documentation or user guide of the specific virtual audio cable software you have installed for more details on how to configure it properly.
